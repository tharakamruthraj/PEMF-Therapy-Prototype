Key Project Highlights

-Engineering Prototype: Built using IRF3205 MOSFETs for high-current switching and a 2N2222 transistor for signal driver stages.
-Therapeutic Mechanism: Stimulates chondrocyte activity and modulates calcium signaling to promote cartilage repair and reduce inflammation.
-Performance: Targeting a field strength of 1–4 Gauss to align with safety and therapeutic standards.
-Clinical Efficacy: Synthesized data shows significant improvement in VAS pain scores and WOMAC functional indices for knee osteoarthritis.
